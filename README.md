# Jet Airplane Performance Estimation: B737 Example

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook detailing the performance estimation of a medium-range jet airplane modeled after the Boeing 737. The analysis encompasses various flight performance aspects using computational methods in Python.

## Analysis Aspects

The performance estimation covers the following aspects:

1. **Drag Polar:** Calculation and visualization of the drag characteristics.
2. **Level Flight Performance:** Analysis includes stalling speed, maximum and minimum speed determination.
3. **Steady Climb Performance:** Estimation of maximum rate and angle of climb, service ceiling, and absolute ceiling.
4. **Range and Endurance:** Evaluation of the aircraft's flight range and endurance capabilities.
5. **Steady Level Co-ordinated Turn:** Computation of the minimum radius and maximum rate of turn.
6. **Take-off and Landing Distances:** Calculation of required distances for take-off and landing phases.

## Repository Structure

- `Performance_Estimation_B737.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the computations and visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory containing data files used in the calculations (if applicable).
- `figures/`: Directory where generated plots and figures are saved.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

## How to Run the Notebook

To run this analysis, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/jet-airplane-performance-estimation.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd jet-airplane-performance-estimation`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
5. Open `Performance_Estimation_B737.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.
6. Run the cells in sequence to view the analysis and results.

## Results

The notebook will provide:
- Detailed calculations for each aspect of performance estimation.
- Plots illustrating the drag polar, flight envelopes, and other relevant performance figures.
- A comprehensive discussion of the results in the context of the Boeing 737 performance characteristics.
